# Learn About Decorators

## 1. Timing Function Execution
> - Write a decorator that measures the time a function takes to execute.

## 2. Debugging function calls
> - Create a decorator to print the function name and the values of it's arguments every time the function is called.

## 3. Cache Returns Values
> - Implement a decorator that caches the return values of a function, so that when it's called with the same arguments, the cahed value is returned instead of re-executing the function
